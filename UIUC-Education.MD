# Why going to the Cloud is important to the Unniversity of Illinois

The first thing that should be defined is "What is the Cloud?". When cloud is discussed it is often misunderstood in not only what it is, but why it's advantagious for organizations like the University of Illinois to make full use of. The term Cloud, our cloud computing refers to the on demand delivery of IT resources via the Internet with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining equipment in a datacenter, the University can consume technology resources such as compute, storage, database, and many other services on an as needed basis. It is similar to how people at home consume electricity. When a person turns on a light switch, the power company sends electricity. With Cloud Computing AWS manages and maintains the physical technology infrastructure in many secure environments across the globe. Businesses are then able to access the resources over the internet to develop and run their applications. Capacity can grow or shrink instantly and the University only pays for what it uses.

## How does the Cloud and our partnership with AWS benefit the Unniversity?

Now that we've covered what the Cloud is, we should look at how it benefits the Unniversity. There are five main areas: Agility, Elasticity, Innovation, Scale, and Cost Savings. Each of these will be discussed below. Furthermore, our partnership entitles us to designated AWS Technical Personel. Ryan Kolak is an AWS Solutions Architect that is designated to the Unniversity and Chris Bell is a Technical Account Manager

### Agility:

AWS lets the Unniversity to quickly spin up resources as they need them. We can deploy hundreds of servers in minutes. This means that we can roll out new applications, experiment, and innovate more quickly and efficiently. If an experiment or application does not work as initially planned or intended we can just as quickly deprovision those resources. This means that if an experiment fails it can be deprovisioned quickly and without risk.

### Elasticity:

In a typical Datacenter setting, we need to purchase and provision our IT resources with enough capacity to handle peak level of activity even though those peaks are not frequent. With AWS, we can provision the ammount of resources that are actually needed. Moreover applications in AWS can automatically and instantly scale up or down along with the needs of the application, which also reduces costs and improves our ability to meet the demands of our staff and students.

### Innovation:
AWS allows us to innovate faster because we can allow our highly valuable IT staff to focus on developing applications and services that are important to our staff and students instead of the heavy lifting that is required with installing and maintainig datacenter infrastructure.

### Scale
AWS has a vast array of services that are available on demand. These include everything from large, high capacity compute servers to very small sererless functions. This means that AWS likely has a services that will meet the exact demands of our applications whether they be large, small, or fluctuate between them.

### Cost Savings
AWS allows us to trade capitol expense for variable expense and only pay for IT infrastructure as we consume it. Only paying for the resources that we need and when we need them is a significant savings opportunity for the Unniversity. Our Partnership with AWS entitles us to a further discount.

# How to learn AWS

So now that we've talked about what the AWS Cloud is, now lets talk about how to advance our knowledge in using it. 

When first starting, AWS can seem overwhelming. A cloud-native paradigm of building infrastructure can be a radical departure from the traditional on-premises way of doing things. And regardless if this is your first time working with infrastructure or you've been tuning Linux kernels for the last decade, it can be hard to know where to start with AWS's selection of over 175 services. [This brief fundamentals course](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/fundamentals-core-concepts/?e=gs2020&p=fundoverview) is a great way to start thinking AWS Cloud Native.

## General AWS Learning and Knowledge

Now that you've established a base understanding of the AWS Fundamentals and the Five Well Architected Pillars it's time to start building a hands on understanding on AWS Services. The [AWS Certified Cloud Practioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) certification is an introductery certification that covers all of the AWS Basics... Everything from how to create an account, log into it, and create your first instance in AWS. [This course on Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/) covers everything you need to know to pass the exam.

## Key skills everyone should know when working with AWS.

When working in AWS there are two key areas that are important to know and understand well, regardless of whether you are solutions architect, developer, or systems opperations. These areas are IAM (Idenity and Access Management) and VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Networking. These are underlying foundational services that nearly all applications will utilize.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

When it comes to Cloud Security, it is important to adopt a **zero trust** access mind set. This starts with AWS IAM, or Identity and Access Management. Below are two excellent and in depth videos of how to get started with IAM and how to master AWS IAM Policies.

### Identity And Access Mangement Basics

[Getting Started with AWS Idenity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvz-qYYhvMk) is a great video to get started with AWS Identity. The number, range, and breadth of AWS services are large, but the set of techniques that you, as a builder in the cloud, will use to secure them is not. Your cloud journey starts with this breakout session, in which we get you up to speed quickly on the practical fundamentals to do identity and authorization right in AWS.

### IAM Policies
Once you have some understanding and experience with AWS IAM. This session [Become an IAM Policy Master in 60 Minutes or Less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQsK4MtsELU&t=1s), covers the different types of policies and describe how they work together to control access to resources in your account and across your AWS organization. We walk through use cases that help you delegate permission management to developers by demonstrating IAM permission boundaries. We take an in-depth look at controlling access to specific AWS regions using condition keys. Finally, we explain how to use tags to scale permissions management in your account. This session requires you to know the basics of IAM policies.

### Virtual Private Cloud Networking (VPC)

In this session: [VPC Fundamentals and Connectivity Options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZAvKgqlrjY) we walk through the fundamentals of Amazon VPC. First, we cover build-out and design fundamentals for VPCs, including picking your IP space, subnetting, routing, security, NAT, and much more. We then transition to different approaches and use cases for optionally connecting your VPC to your physical data center with VPN or AWS Direct Connect. This mid-level architecture discussion is aimed at architects, network administrators, and technology decision makers interested in understanding the building blocks that AWS makes available with Amazon VPC. Learn how you can connect VPCs with your offices and current data center footprint.


# AWS Certification Paths

AWS offers 3 primary paths for certification: Solutions Architect, Developer, and Systems Opperations. Each of these areas have two tiers of certification. Associates, which are intended for Intermediate (1-2 years experience) skill levels and Professional, which are intended for advanced skill levels (2+ years experience). In addition to that there are six advanced specialty certifications for specific topics: Security, Advanced Networking, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Database, and Alexa Skill Builder.

In the sections below, details and resources on the Assoicate skill level certifications are covered.
